=======================

A useless utility code library in Java.

This is an unmaintained project, which used to be lots of utility code for
Java.

It was written in the (not so) olden times, when Java 1.5 was still the very
new and hip thing. Lots (or everything) of what is contained in this project is
now made obsolete by some corresponding addition to Java's standard SDK, or by
their own sheer immaturity.

Presented here, for reference, memory, analysis and (most importantly)
historical value.
